## Chapter 7: Closure vs Object

### Highlights

#### Closures and objects

##### Similarities

- Two different representations of the same thing (p180)
- Both ways to express collections of state (p184)
- Can both also bundle data with behavior, aka "express encapsulation" (p184-185)
- Both have identical mutation behavior (p187)
- "...closures and objects are isomorphic representations of state (and its associated functionality)." (p190)

##### Differences

- Structure of a closure is not mutable, but objects are mutable (p192)
- Privacy: losures have lexical closure hiding, but all properties on objects are public (p194)

### Discussion Topics

1. Did anyone read the [MIT paper cited in the opening koan](http://people.csail.mit.edu/gregs/ll1-discuss-archive-html/msg03277.html)? Anything good in there?
2. Did anyone do the example on p181 (representing object as a closure or vice versa)? What did you come up with?
3. On page 188, author states "...at the lowest level, all state data is primitives, and all primitives are value-immutable. Whether you represent this state with nested objects, or with nested closures, the values being held are all immutable." Let's break down this statement. Do we agree?
